# roadwork-tasksplit — any document or list becomes a group of todos, verbatim

Roadwork conventions: this skill's glossary; in a workspace, its rules file as well. `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`
takes a product requirements document and makes features and todos with a
sanity todo; this skill takes the small case — "similar to roadmap-prd,
takes a list of tasks and creates a group of todos" (Operator, 2026-09-11) —
where the source's units already are todos. It adds nothing of its own:
"make sure everything relevant to todo is verbatim copied from source, make
sure to capture into each todo all relevant context from the source"
(Operator, 2026-09-11).

## 1. Read the source

A batch (`ref && ref`) is refused here: one source at a time.

The source "could be many types of document or a list" (Operator):
a file cited by path, or pasted text. A paste is stored whole, first, as
`docs/<name>.source.md` in the register's `docs/` — `<name>` from the source's title
or first line, kebab-case, never reused — and cited by that path from then
on. The skill never edits the source. Read it whole.

## 2. Delineate

The units are what the source itself delineates: its list items, its
headings, its numbered steps, its paragraphs where nothing finer exists.
One todo per unit — never merged or split beyond the source's structure.
An item that reads as a capability is still a todo; the skill never files
a feature and never refuses a unit for its shape. Dependencies exist only
where the source states an order or a dependency in words.

## 3. Read back once

Present the units as a numbered list, each with the source's words it
will carry and the dependencies the source states, plus the group's
name and where the block will sit in `ordering.md` —
where the Operator says at the read-back; the default is below the
lifecycle group. Ask
whether the split is right, and wait — the units are read back once, never
twice; corrections are folded in and the filing proceeds on the Operator's
word.

## 4. File every todo through `/roadwork-ingest`'s form

Each unit becomes one todo in `roadwork/todo/unnavigated/<item-name>/` (a navigation's units under its destination's folder) — item names by
`/roadwork-ingest`'s rule (kebab-case, in the source's words for that unit,
never reused, never a skill name) — with the four files of the form:

- the item file: the eight keys (`road-level` empty — a tasksplit navigates nothing), `group: [<source-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>]`,
  `blocked-by`/`blocking` only where the source states them; the title in
  the source's words; the status line "open — filed by /roadwork-tasksplit
  from <source path>; not yet interviewed"; the notes: the unit's own words
  verbatim under `**Source (<path>, verbatim):**`; then
  `**Context from the source (verbatim):**` — every passage of the source
  that bears on the unit, quoted; the filer's reading reads exactly
  "from <source path>, verbatim, no reading added"; the not-decided list
  carries only questions the source itself poses, or "none the source
  poses";
- `intent.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`: the placeholders of the form.

Nothing is paraphrased; nothing the source does not say enters a todo.

The item file carries its `**Paths:**` line as `/roadwork-ingest` §3 gives it, when the source names paths.

## 5. The block in `ordering.md`

As `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` §5: one indented block under the group's line, the
todos in the source's order, placed where the read-back settled. No
sanity todo is created and nothing blocks the group: "we can skip sanity
checking for this" (Operator). The group is never cohorted ("no cohort
subagenting" — Operator): todos only, so `/roadwork-subagentifygroup` does
not apply.

## 6. Commit and hand back

Commit in the register (its commits local).
Reply with the group's name, the source's path, and every todo filed with
its reference; say that the Operator may run `/roadwork-navsanity <group>`
by hand later. End by offering the next step for the group's first todo —
`/roadwork-intentify <ref>` — as one invocation in its own code block, preceded by its sentence (offer form), never
invoked, then the back offers as `/roadwork-ingest` §5b computes them. Then the fact suffix, by the clock (the glossary's **Fact suffix** entry). As a checkbox list where the harness has a question tool, blocks otherwise (the glossary's **Offer form** entry).

## Never

Never a feature; never a PRD (that is `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`); never a sanity todo
or a sanity check; never a cohort; never a reading added; never a
paraphrase of the source; never a second read-back; never a PR.

**Text for the Operator.** In text for the Operator, use the plain words of the terms table — `docs/terms.md` in the register, one row per term: the plain word, the agent's word, the meaning; the agent's words stay in the skill.

## Glossary

- **Roadwork** — the Roadwork system by 2nd Cortex Labs — road plans and the skills that work them.
- **Road plans** — the project's `roadwork/`: the one place its work is recorded. Three **sub-registers**: `todo/` (fixes, chores, decisions, findings), `feature/` (new capabilities), `spark/` (ideas; never worked); the test: a todo is done once, a feature is reused when built — the Operator may name the kind against it.
- **Item** — one folder under its destination's folder in a sub-register (`unnavigated/` until a navigation cites it): `todo.md` or `feature.md` (the **item file**) plus `intent.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`; a spark holds only `idea.md`.
- **Home** — the register an item lives in: the project's one register, at the path the project's law names; a clone of a remote, never pushed.
- **Reference (ref)** — `todo/<item-name>`, `feature/<item-name>`, `spark/<item-name>`; from anywhere, `main/<kind>/<item-name>` — the project's law may alias the prefix.
- **Frontmatter** — the YAML block opening an item file: `blocker`, `blocking`, `blocked-by`, `external`, `group`, `in-process`, `disposition`, `road-level` (the item's level within its destination — `main`, `secondary`, `side` — or empty), a feature's `onroad-cohort` before it.
- **External** — the `external` key: an externality, a dependency that will not be met without something specific and out-of-band happening (Operator, 2026-10-11); an operational pause in the due course — a push, a merge, a fetch, a reboot — is never one. Stated by the spec skill as a fact in the spec's Dependencies section (what, who acts, how observed) — one entry per out-of-band act, never per party or per service — and written on spec acceptance: a `blocked-by` where another item acts, the key's text where another party does, with the item file's dated `**External set**` line; emptied only by the Operator, with the dated `**External cleared**` line; `/roadwork-make` refuses while it is set; its observed-by part run as a test at acceptance and before a make, a command deciding it where one is written, the Operator's word where not; notified where the workspace names an address.
- **`ordering.md`** — the register's loose priority list; top is next. **`working.md`** — the register's dated list of items in process.
- **Operator (user)** — the human owner; every decision is theirs.
- **Session agent** — the agent running the session that invokes the skill.
- **Project scope** — everything at and under the root the project's law names; the paths an item touches are its **Paths:** line.
- **Batch** — the coherent bundle a project's changes ship in as one PR; the register's own commits are local and never a PR.
- **Lifecycle** — `/roadwork-atlas` (three documents into an atlas, above a destination) → `/roadwork-destination` → `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` (a destination into a group) → `/roadwork-ingest` → `/roadwork-intentify` → `/roadwork-specplan` → `/roadwork-make` (the go — the skill or the Operator's word; builds under `/unlazy`) → `/roadwork-verify-and-archive`. Every skill ends by offering the next. Beside the chain, `/roadwork-help` answers and `/roadwork-intent-insights` learns from the day's interviews.
- **PRD** — a product requirements document, `destinations/<destination-slug>.prd.md`, made by `/roadwork-destination` and the source of a group of items made by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; cited by path in every derived item.
- **Destination** — two files beside each other in `destinations/`: `<destination-slug>.intent.md`, what is wanted and why in the Operator's words, in the item intent's form, interviewed and written first; and `<destination-slug>.prd.md`, written from it, in a fixed form (a frontmatter block with `bucket-list-priority`, 1–10, 10 the highest, and `atlas`; the destination, a Stack section — the architecture read, the guidebooks drawn on, the changes to their stacks — numbered requirements, Out, Success); its slug categorises the register's items — one destination per item, the group's, written on the item by `/roadwork-nav-to-destination`; both files archived to `destinations/archive/` by hand when built.
- **Map** — one `maps/<destination-slug>.md`: the way to one destination, one map per destination — before agents, process, stack, judgements, inputs — in a fixed form, made by `/roadwork-map`, drawing on guidebooks by copying their relevant parts in (a **Guidebooks:** line names them); named on an item by its **Map:** line, one per item, read by `/roadwork-intentify` and `/roadwork-specplan`; enforced by nothing; retired to `maps/archive/` by hand.
- **Stack** — what a destination is built on: environment, framework, tooling, assets and services; chosen per destination from the guidebooks, carried by the requirements file, the map, the spec and the plan.
- **Sanity todo** — the todo `/roadwork-nav-to-destination` creates last, `todo/<destination-slug>-sanity`: the group list and the requirement↔item mapping both ways; blocks every other item in the group until the Operator says the group is right.
- **Check types** — the six sanity checks `/roadwork-navsanity` runs over a group: completeness, provenance, shape, dependencies, order, scope.
- **Run** — one pass of `/roadwork-navsanity` over a group: six checks, ten questions, the changes made; recorded as a dated section in the group's sanity todo.
- **Hand-made group** — a group not born of a PRD; its requirements are its members' own claims plus the group's line in `ordering.md`.
- **Cohort** — a subgroup of a group's features that can be built in parallel by sub-agents: the rubric passes on every criterion; named in each member's `onroad-cohort`.
- **Cohortmeister (CM)** — `feature/cm-<group>-<cohort>`: the pseudo-feature that blocks a cohort's members, is onroaded in their place, and whose ledger is the results checker; archives them by cascade.
- **Rubric** — the five pass/fail criteria a subgroup must meet to be a cohort: no dependency edge, disjoint ownership, accepted spec and plan with gates, no external and not in process, self-contained builds.
- **Reconsideration** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s second mode: on an item whose accepted spec and plan already exist, re-read them against everything dated since; a dated `Reconsidered` changelog, proven gates carried, the previous go ended, the spec proposed again.
- **Verification round** — `/roadwork-specplan`'s fresh-eyes check: six predefined questions on the spec, five on the plan, one fresh reader each — run as one workflow where the harness runs workflows, on the top model of the tier one step below the session's (or the session's own where no lower tier exists) at an effort the dispatcher sets, findings in one bounded shape (file, line, one sentence, an empty disposition slot; at most eight; "clean" as none), sub-agents the fallback — findings incorporated or rejected with a reason and recorded in the document by the session agent; one round per document.
- **Back offers** — the second offer line of the four interrupting skills: up to five open lifecycle steps in flight, most recent first, read from the road plans; offers, never runs; each preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does.
- **Item name** — the kebab-case folder name of an item, chosen at ingest in the Operator's words, the last part of its reference (`todo/<item-name>`, `main/<kind>/<item-name>`); never reused; never a skill name. "Slug" is a generic word, not the register's term; the register names its slugs by their bearer — `<destination-slug>`, `<map-slug>`, `<guidebook-slug>`, `<atlas-slug>`.
- **Batch invocation** — one skill, many references on one line, separated by ` && `; accepted by `/roadwork-verify-and-archive` and `/roadwork-make`, and by `/roadwork-ingest` for a spark batch only (sparks of one home, converting into one item — the bare `/roadwork-spark` lists them grouped), refused by the rest with a reason; offers are printed as invocations in code blocks, related ones combined.
- **Bare call** — a skill invoked with no argument lists instead of acting — `/roadwork-spark` the open sparks grouped for conversion, `/roadwork-destination` the destinations with their navigation state, `/roadwork-make` the make-eligible items with their goes and the ineligible with their reasons, `/roadwork-inventory` everything open on one page in the ordering's order; a bare call writes nothing.
- **Offer form** — every command or phrase a reply suggests the Operator type is printed in its own fenced code block (three backticks, no language tag), nothing else in the block, one per block, so it copies in one gesture; invocations that run as one line — a batch invocation with ` && ` — share one block; prose around the block says what it does; an offered invocation is preceded by one sentence saying what typing it does. The copy a skill carries for use outside a workspace; in a workspace the reply-form rule holds it. Where the harness has a question tool, the offers of a hand-back are one list of choices — each the invocation with its sentence — plus "none of these" and a free-text choice; a tick is the Operator's word, run in the same turn; blocks where there is no tool. Where an offer waits on the Operator's word, the block — or the choice's label — carries both, `<word> and <invocation>`; the word is recorded as the Operator's, dated, before the invocation runs. Before such an offer, each concern or gate its word answers is restated simply right above it — one bullet, the question in plain words, the options with the recommended one first and its reason, two sentences at most; a gate's bullet says what is approved and where it was shown (Operator, 2026-10-14). Every offer printed as a block carries an id, `O1`, `O2`, … in printing order, in bold at the start of its sentence; the id typed alone is the Operator's word for that offer, read as the whole block, recorded in full with the id after it; nothing changes where the offers go through the question tool (Operator, 2026-10-15). Where typing it makes or changes something, the sentence carries, in parentheses right after the thing acted on, what is to be accomplished — the change or the product itself, as what will exist or be said afterwards, a few words opening "to", specific to the item where the item is known, never a sentence, never the skill's definition, never the reason, the gate, the authority or the item — "runs the map skill on the-lifecycle (to rename its Assets and tools section to Stack)"; a directive phrase the same; a bare listing or a help call, which leaves nothing behind, carries none; the Gate id entry's parenthetical says what a thing is, this one what a run accomplishes (Operator, 2026-10-07).
- **Fact suffix** — after the last offer of a lifecycle hand-back, when the machine's minute is a multiple of six: one blank line, a horizontal rule (a run of hyphens on its own line, rendered as a rule, never a literal line of characters), one blank line, then the title line "A 2ndcortex/roadwork system detail you should know about:" plain, then one fact from `docs/facts.md`, picked by the seconds modulo the count of its numbered facts — never a heading, then "Typing this explains it:" and `/roadwork-help <term>` in its own code block; never after `/roadwork-help`; no state, no script.
- **Tasksplit** — `/roadwork-tasksplit <source>`: any document or list into a dated group of todos, one per unit the source delineates, the source's words verbatim and no reading added; no sanity todo, no cohort.
